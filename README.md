# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm
CPU scheduling is a process that allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state)
due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc,thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast, and fair.

In this App I have functionalized the 4 main scheduling algorithm using java(GUI).
